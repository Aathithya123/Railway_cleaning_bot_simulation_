# Railway_cleaning_bot_simulation_
This railway track cleaning bot uses four DC motors for movement and two for cleaning the inside of the track. Ultrasonic sensors detect obstacles, and servo motors with brushes clear them. The bot sends notifications via OneSignal if an obstacle can't be cleared and stops until resolved. It simulates real-time operation using Python scripts.
